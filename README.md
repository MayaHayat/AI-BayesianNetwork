# Bayesian Network

In this project we had to implement 3 different methods of finding the probability and compare them.
The algorithms we had to implement are:
  1. Simple deduction 
  2. Variable elimination (where the elimination order is alphabetically)
  3. Variable elimination (where the elimination order is according the the sum of all factors that a variable is found in)

## Input
We were given an XML file which we had to read the network from (an example is also found in this project).
After having read the XML the next step was creating the network and connecting all nodes and then implementing all 3 algorithms.
